## THOUGHTS

Is it possible to make chemistry fun for the average gamer? Seems like a good question to answer before making a game about chemistry, right?

If you're anything like the average high school student, chemistry class was probably not a pleasant experience. Lots of confusing nomenclature to parse while spending an inordinate amount of time to memorize those seemingly arbitrary rules and all their exceptions. To top it off, a good heaping of math sprinkled throughout, made more difficult by your teacher insisting that every answer must have some unfamiliar units tacked on at the end.

<figure class="align-center">
  <a href="#"><img src="{{ site.url }}/img/posts/2022-11-01-Changelogv002/Deathnote_units.jpg" width="500" height="352"></a>
</figure>

Most of all though, chemistry is probably the first subject you encounter where it's very difficult to map the theory you learn to your experience in the macroscopic world. 

_Sure, you tell me that there are an almost uncountable number of molecules whizzing around, bumping, jostling, and colliding over and over again. They can react, diffuse, clump together, fly apart, be destroyed, and come back together... but in lab, I'm just mixing two clear liquids together to make another clear solution that might as well be water. What's the big deal?_

It's unsatisfying because I can't actually see what's going on. 

It's boring because I have to memorize all of this stuff, with no intuition for why it's important.

Worse yet, the rules that I memorize seem to be useless half the time, because there are so many freaking exceptions to the rules.

**How the hell did anyone figure this stuff out, and what's it useful for anyways?**

These are all totally reasonable questions, and it's a shame that chemistry is not taught in the same way that it was discovered, using logic and deduction rather than memorization. Some of the concepts you learn about (like the distinction between organic and inorganic chemistry) really only make sense in the context of the scientific theories (like [vitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalism)) that came before them, but most students don't receive lessons couched in the history of chemical sciences.

I was fortunate to have an amazing high school chemistry teacher who did his best to bring the subject to life; most people are not so lucky. 
Even so, I struggled to really internalize the things I was learning about, because I didn't have a proper visualization of what was going on "under the hood".

There must be room to improve the way people experience chemistry, beyond what you can get from a book. 

Could chemistry be fun for the average gamer? Yes, I think so, from the right point of view. The point of view where you can have an intuitive understanding of molecular behavior and the macroscopic properties that emerge from that. And what better perspective than the one that puts you right at the molecular level? 

<figure class="align-center">
  <a href="#"><img src="{{ site.url }}/img/posts/2022-11-01-Changelogv002/DiffusionSim.gif" alt=""></a>
  <figcaption>Away from all the math and formulas, you have something that's easy to understand. A bunch of balls bouncing around a box.</figcaption>
</figure> 

There's something visually arresting about a simulation like this, no? Some part of our reptile brains is perfectly content just watching things bounce around in an orderly and predicable way.

<figure class="align-center">
  <a href="#"><img src="{{ site.url }}/img/posts/2022-11-01-Changelogv002/the-office-dvd-cube.gif" alt=""></a>
  <figcaption>Really want to tap into this kind of energy for the game</figcaption>
</figure> 

So, here's the starting point. To make a fun game about chemistry, I want a way to represent molecules in a computer, at the level of bouncing balls in a box. We need to make those molecules move around, collide with each other in a satisfying way, and ultimately do interesting reactions. What could go wrong? 

Let's get to it! 

---

#### Step 1: Visuals

For this project, I've chosen the [Unity](https://unity.com/) game engine. There's tons of reasons for this, but I like it mostly for it's component-based architecture.
Everything you interact with in the game is contained within a game object, and this will be our container for individual molecules as well.

Starting with the visual appearance, I want everything about the game to be as intuitive as possible, including the way the molecules look. Instead of relying on a knowledge of valence electrons or the octet rule, wouldn't it be nice to communicate how a particular atom will bond just by using simple shapes?

<figure class="align-center">
  <a href="#"><img src="{{ site.url }}/img/posts/2022-11-01-Changelogv002/shapes_white text.PNG"></a>
</figure>

Is this a better way of visualizing the chemistry of different kinds of atoms? It does take some time to get used to if you are really familiar with more traditional representations. I don't know for sure, but I feel like it's worth putting it out there to get your feedback. If you have strong opinions either way, feel free to let me know.

We can also define realistic chemical & physical properties for each unique molecule, packaged in these nice Unity containers called Scriptable Objects. More details on these in a future post; for now, the only property we really care about for collisions is the molecular weight:

<figure class="align-center">
  <a href="#"><img src="{{ site.url }}/img/posts/2022-11-01-Changelogv002/H2_SO.PNG"></a>
</figure>

---

#### Step 2: Collisions

With the visuals sorted, we can give the molecules some life by making them move around and bump into each other. It's sort of poetic that one of the first things needed for a realistic chemistry system is physics. Fortunately, Unity does most of the legwork here using its built-in 2D physics system based on Rigidbodies and Colliders.
All we have to do is give the molecules a bit of a push:

```cs
var moleculeScript = newMolecule.GetComponent<Molecule>();
moleculeScript.rb.AddForce(firingVector * Mathf.Sqrt(2 * kineticEnergy * moleculeScript.rb.mass), ForceMode2D.Impulse);
```

Here, I'm getting the reference to a newly created molecule and its attached rigidbody. Then, I can specify a target kinetic energy for the molecule, applying that force instantaneously as an impulse, and the physics system figures out how fast the molecule should move based on its molecular weight.

<figure class="align-center">
  <a href="#"><img src="{{ site.url }}/img/posts/2022-11-01-Changelogv002/singlecollision.gif"></a>
  <figcaption>The I<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> have the same kinetic energy here.</figcaption>
</figure>

Success! Now what happens when we put a bunch of molecules in a box and make them collide with each other?

<figure class="align-center">
  <a href="#"><img src="{{ site.url }}/img/posts/2022-11-01-Changelogv002/multiplecollisions.gif"></a>
</figure>

With some small tweaks to the way the physics engine calculates collisions, these molecules will bounce around indefinitely (you'll have to take my word for it). Energy is being conserved (for now). 

Excellent. We're ready for reactions! 

_Side note: If you are from a chemistry background, you may already be scratching your head a bit. Where's the intermolecular potential? Molecules should feel influence from each other before they physically "touch". And why are they touching anyways? Is anything quantized? There's no way that is a realistic distribution of translational vs. rotational energy. And let's not even start talking about QM Etc etc etc..._

_And you would be right. I suspect this will be a constant struggle to balance realistic behavior with fun, fluid gameplay feel. Although some of these things I do plan to at least experiment with, I want to always keep one principle held above all others: This is a game first, and to whatever extent I can, a reflection of real-world chemistry second._

_My philosophy on this is heavily influenced by a talk Jonathan Blow gave on [the future of educational games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWFScmtiC44&t=6737s). Basically, he feels the reason most "educational" games are terrible is because they try to be too on-the-nose about trying to just lift material out of a textbook and put it into the context of a game, rather than making a gameplay experience that feels good first. In my case, I want to make a fun game first and foremost, which right now means getting to a playable prototype as soon as possible. Of course, I want to make sure fundamental aspects of chemistry are accounted for (stoichiometry, equilibrium, conservation of mass & energy, etc). Later on, hopefully I can come back to add in some of the smaller details that bring the game closer to reality.  But not too close:_

#### Step 3: Reactions

In the real world, reactions will only take place if certain conditions are met:
1. They have mutually reactive functional groups
2. They collide in the correct orientation for those functional groups to react
3. They have the minimum kinetic energy needed to overcome the activation energy barrier for breaking/forming new bonds.

To detect requirement #1 in a computer-based system is actually more complicated than it first seems. Reactions are a tricky subject, mostly because of how varied and exceptional they can be depending on the unique identity of the participating molecules. However, to make a fun game, I think the player needs to have some level of consistency in the way the elements of the game interact with each other. To service that end, I've decided to base the reaction system in my game on functional groups (as opposed to some kind of mechanistic, first principles approach). Essentially, if a molecule contains a given functional group, it will react the same way with other functional groups of a specific type, regardless of what else might be attached to the other side of the molecule.

<figure class="align-center">
  <a href="#"><img src="{{ site.url }}/img/posts/2022-11-01-Changelogv002/primaryOHex_white.PNG"></a>
  <figcaption>(a) The reaction between a primary alcohol and acid chloride should not be significantly affected by carbon chain length.<br>(b) We can generalize the reaction like this to show that the R group can be changed.</figcaption>
</figure>

This is a core principle of chemistry, but of course, reality is not so [simple](https://www.masterorganicchemistry.com/2011/02/01/the-most-annoying-exceptions-in-org-1-part-1/). When it makes sense, I plan to incorporate exceptions to these rules to keep things interesting. 

A key benefit of using functional groups: I won't have to program a unique reaction between each possible pair of molecules; instead, I can define a base reaction using something like the [SMARTS language](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smarts.html[). Then, use a cheminformatics framework like [RDkit](https://www.rdkit.org/) to help me predict the products of any given reaction between sets of molecules with the same functional groups in a scalable way (more to say on this in a future post).

However, for the purposes of prototyping, I am hard-coding reactions for the moment.<br>
<br>

To meet the second requirement, the functional group representations in the game need to have some sense of locality within the molecule. In other words, when one molecule collides with another, did they collide in such a way that their functional groups could react together? If not, the reaction should have no chance to proceed.

This should already lead to some emergent sterics behavior seen in organic chemistry for instance, where reactions between more hindered functional groups proceed much more slowly (or not at all).

In game, we can simulate this by giving each molecule several colliders. One collider is used for the physics system to allow the molecule to bounce off other things, and other colliders can serve as triggers to a reaction system written in code. 

<figure class="align-center">
  <a href="#"><img src="{{ site.url }}/img/posts/2022-11-01-Changelogv002/Hydrogen_colliders.PNG" width="50%" height=auto></a>
</figure>

At the end of each frame, a "Reaction Manager" object parses all of the possible collisions that could result in a reaction, checks to see if the functional groups are compatible & there is sufficient net kinetic energy to overcome the reaction's activation energy. If so, the Reaction Manager allows the reaction to proceed by removing the reactants from the game and instantiating new product molecules.

We can also simulate exo/endothermic behavior by adding or taking away a bit of energy from the resulting product molecules.

Let's take the simple reaction H<sub>2</sub> + I<sub>2</sub> â‡Œ 2HI as an example. By defining separate activation energies for the forwards and backwards reactions, we can see some interesting equilibrium behavior emerge from the system we've implemented already:

<figure class="align-center">
  <a href="#"><img src="{{ site.url }}/img/posts/2022-11-01-Changelogv002/equilibrium.gif"></a>
  <figcaption>Note that the backwards reaction is slower in real life (see <a href="https://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/classicalcs/bodenkin.html">Bodenstein kinetics</a>). While I haven't checked yet if the reaction seen here follows second-order kinetics behavior, I plan to run the reaction with different concentrations of starting reagents to determine if that's the case.</figcaption>
</figure>

As it turned out, getting to this stage was the easy part. A small bug in the code resulted in energy not being conserved when new product molecules were being born, because I was not calculating the net rotational energy of the reactants correctly. This resulted in some strange behavior, like these spontaneous convection currents forming from initial randomness:

<figure class="align-center">
  <a href="#"><img src="{{ site.url }}/img/posts/2022-11-01-Changelogv002/Task3.2_HIclockwise.gif"></a>
  <figcaption>This took much longer than it should have to fix...</figcaption>
</figure>

I farted around with different ways of trying to balance the rotations of the reactants and products. Eventually, I realized that in elastic collisions, both translational and rotational energy are conserved. So take your equation for kinetic energy, swap out mass and velocity for inertia and angular velocity, and finally, a chemistry simulation that even a physicist could love, complete with reactions that never stop. 

While there's still a ton more work to be done in the future to tune all the various constants controlling the reaction kinetics & equilibrium, this serves as a great basis for the game going forward.

On a separate note, it's really satisfying to watch the H<sub>2</sub> + I<sub>2</sub> â‡Œ 2HI reaction with the huge differential in mass between the molecular iodine and hydrogen. Although the visuals don't quite match the realistic size of these two molecules (a stylistic choice for now), I like watching the hydrogen spawn from the reverse reaction and immediately get sent whizzing around like a pinball until eventually finding another I<sub>2</sub> molecule to react with. 

---

Another question worth considering: how granular should the reactions get in terms of intermediates? Is it more fun to show complex reactions, like the combustion of hydrogen, with each and every elementary reaction accounted for? Or is it enough to just visualize the overall reaction?

<figure class="align-center">
  <a href="#"><img src="{{ site.url }}/img/posts/2022-11-01-Changelogv002/h2combustion.gif"></a>
  <figcaption>The reactions in this sim follow the mechanism below.</figcaption>

</figure>

As you can see, the simulated reaction is maybe more realistic, but also a lot more chaotic. It's hard for someone to understand what's happening at a glance, and having all of the extra reactions means having to balance a lot more interactions, not to mention the overhead of creating the extra game elements needed to support this.

I don't know which one is better. Ultimately, whichever one produces the best game experience will win, but I don't think it's something I can decide for myself. I need your help to figure it out (which is why I want to get a demo up and running as soon as possible!).

Finally, let's talk about what the main game loop for Defenthesis might look like. In my head, I see something like this:

<figure class="align-center">
  <a href="#"><img src="{{ site.url }}/img/posts/2022-11-01-Changelogv002/gameloop2.PNG"></a>
  <figcaption>Molecules go in, different molecules come out.</figcaption>
</figure>

The player is somehow responsible for designing the system that converts reactants to products, and building the game around the concept of tower defense seemed like a natural choice. Rather than monsters to destroy or bloons to pop, you apply your knowledge of chemical transformations to produce the appropriate output at the end of the level.

Watching molecules bounce around inside a box is fun for a bit, but there needs to be a way for the player to feel a sense of progression or accomplishment as well. The greatest feelings of pride I've felt as a gamer come from games like Factorio, where the objective is to build up these massive factories and systems that take raw materials and gradually turn them into more and more valuable components... and at some point in the play session (usually deep into the next morning), you look back on the work you've done to get to that point and can't believe how complex and impressive it is. That's the feeling I want players to chase in this game as well. 

I was planning to discuss how I implemented the towers themselves in this post, but its already quite long, so I think I will save the explanation for next time. Suffice it to say, towers can currently:
- Be programmed to spawn in new molecules of a given type
- Shoot molecules with a desired average kinetic energy
- Survey the molecules within a given range, select a target that is able to react with the type of molecule they are shooting, and track that target until they are ready to shoot

Perhaps most obviously, towers give the player a handle to control the stoichiometry of the flow reaction. Unlike most tower defense games, its not about how many towers you have, or how powerful they can become. Instead, players will have to find just the right balance of tower quantity and placement, and I'm already seeing some interesting consequences of tower layout that run contrary to what most tower defense games require (stay tuned for the next post).

Adding towers into the game feels like a great mechanic, and I can already see opportunities to include things like automated process control into the game to allow the player to build up potentially massive chemical factories, with hundreds of thousands of molecules being simulated simultaneously powered by the upcoming Unity [DOTS](https://unity.com/dots) workflow. Realistic chemical & physical properties, unit operations like distillation & extraction, moddability to allow players to define any number of molecules & reactions of their choosing...

But all in good time :) For now, I'm going to focus on the next step, which is maximizing the fun within this core game loop. 

See ya!
