## THOUGHTS
This is my attempt to make a game that gives players something unique. A game that really leans into the experience of solving problems in chemistry and engineering, but relying on intuition rather than book knowledge. My goal is to make a game that anyone can pick up, play, and also discover the things that make the chemical sciences so much fun for me. Except you won't have to spend 10 years doing lab work to realize it like I did :)

With these changelogs, I hope I can give you some insights into my game dev process and entertain you along the way. They are also to help me think and stay motivated. In the age of YouTube, Tiktok, and so many other remarkable time sinks, it's a small miracle that you are even reading this. So thank you.

Although the game is in early stages, please check in occasionally for new updates & playable web demos. 
I will be adding an option to subscribe for automatic email updates soon. 

Thanks!
